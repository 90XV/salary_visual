# Salary and Savings Calculator
This simple webapp focuses on helping users create a graph to guide them on how much they need to save monthly to reach a goal in a certain amount of time.

## Example
Variables:
-Salary: $2000
-Saving Goal: $10000 (optional reason can be stated. eg. wedding)
-Due date: 015/06/2026

Users then have to state how much they are willing to save either in the form of percentage eg. 50% or a fixed amount eg. $750.

The app will then take these variables and output a graph (could be realtime). 

The graph can show how long it will take to save up depening on the variables. eg: $10 000 before 15/06/2026 , monthly saving of $800 will take a XX months to save up to $25 000.

## Development
I don't really know what stack im going with here but I think I will start with the UI
